# Product Context: Excel Data Importer

## Problem Statement
The current process for importing blacklist data from Excel files is presumed to be manual, slow, and susceptible to human error. This project aims to solve the problem of inefficient and unreliable data entry into the `blacklist.entity` database table. Without automation, the business faces risks of data quality issues, delays in data availability, and a lack of traceability for import processes.

## User Experience Goals
- **For Data Providers (users uploading Excel files)**:
  - The process should be seamless. A user simply uploads a file to a specific SharePoint folder.
  - Users should receive clear, actionable feedback via email if their file fails validation, enabling them to correct it and re-submit.
  - Users should have confidence that their data is processed correctly, confirmed by the file being moved to the `imported` folder.
- **For System Administrators/Data Consumers**:
  - The data in the `blacklist.entity` table should be consistently reliable and up-to-date.
  - The import process should be easily monitored through structured logs in a system like ElasticSearch.
  - The entire pipeline should be autonomous, requiring no manual intervention for successful runs.

## Success Metrics
- **Automation Level**: 100% of valid Excel files are processed automatically from SharePoint to PostgreSQL.
- **Data Accuracy**: A measurable reduction in validation errors and data inconsistencies in the `blacklist.entity` table over time.
- **Processing Time**: A significant decrease in the end-to-end time from file upload to data availability in the database.
- **System Reliability**: The Airflow DAG executes successfully according to its schedule, with a high uptime and effective failure alerting.

# Progress: Excel Data Importer

## What Works
- **Project Scaffolding**: All initial project files (`main.py`, `utils.py`, etc.) and configuration/schema files are in place.
- **Core Data Pipeline**: The data transformation and validation logic in `utils.py` is implemented.
- **Separated Test Runner**: A dedicated test script (`run_tests.py`) allows for local testing of the entire data pipeline, completely separate from the production application code (`main.py`).
- **Realistic Testing**: The test process reads from a physical Excel file (`test_data.xlsx`), providing a high-fidelity test of the import and parsing logic.
- **Negative Testing**: The test suite has been enhanced to include known-bad data in `test_data.xlsx`. The test runner (`run_tests.py`) now specifically verifies that these expected errors are caught, ensuring the validation logic is robust.
- **Successful Test Run**: The test script has been successfully run against both valid and invalid data, proving the core logic works as expected.
- **Test Artifacts**: A `test_data.xlsx` file exists containing a mix of valid and invalid records.

## What's Left to Build
The primary remaining task is to replace all placeholder functions in `utils.py` with real implementations that interact with external services.
- **SharePoint Integration**:
  - Implement `get_new_files` to authenticate with SharePoint and fetch new Excel files.
  - Implement `move_file` to move files to the `imported` and `broken` folders.
- **Database Interaction**:
  - Implement `connect_to_db` to establish a real connection to the PostgreSQL database.
  - Implement `find_existing_record` and `insert_record` with real SQL queries to handle data versioning and insertion.
- **Notification Service**:
  - Implement `send_error_email` to connect to an SMTP server and send validation error reports.
- **Phase 2 - Airflow DAG**:
  - Refactor the completed application into an Airflow DAG.
  - Replace local schema validation with the REST API call.

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **No Live Integration**: The application currently cannot connect to any real external services as all related functions are placeholders.
- **SharePoint API Uncertainty**: The exact methods for retrieving the "Created By" user from a file's metadata still need to be confirmed with a specific SharePoint client library during implementation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial State**: The project began with requirements documented in `prompt_eng.md`.
- **Formalize Knowledge**: The first action was to create the Memory Bank to structure all project information.
- **Separation of Test Logic**: The project was refactored to fully separate test execution (`run_tests.py`) from production code (`main.py`).
- **Negative Test Cases**: The testing strategy was evolved to include negative testing. The test data now includes invalid records, and the test runner asserts that these specific errors are correctly identified.
- **Realistic Test Data**: The test process uses a physical Excel file (`test_data.xlsx`) for all local testing.
